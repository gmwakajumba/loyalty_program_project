# loyalty_program_project
This project started as an analysis of the Top 10% highest-paying customers (60 clients) of a DVD Rental Storeâ€™s database. Once the Top 60 clients are extracted, I will analyze what percentage of them rented multiple dvds in one day. The idea is to propose a loyalty program to encourage multiple rentals in one visit.
